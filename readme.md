## About the App

Hardwared is a fully functioning custom webshop created as a rebrand for NZXT. The backend is built with **Django Rest Framework**, serving a **React** frontend. This was my first React application, which I built to learn the basics of React and to practice integrating it with any kind of REST API endpoints.
